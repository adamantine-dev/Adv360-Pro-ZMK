      Enable full N-Key Roll Over for HID output. This selection will prevent the keyboard
      from working with some BIOS/UEFI versions that only support "boot keyboard" support.
      This option also prevents using some infrequently used higher range HID usages (notably F13-F24 and INTL1-9)
      These usages can be re enabled with ZMK_HID_KEYBOARD_NKRO_EXTENDED_REPORT.
